projects:
  - Reduced Food Waste__Project Drawdown defines reduced food waste as
    minimizing food loss and wastage from all stages of production,
    distribution, retail, and consumption. This solution replaces current
    reported trends in food waste by
    region.____2021-11-04-map-name-reduced-food-waste-active-true-description-project-drawdown-defines-reduced-food-waste-as-minimizing-food-loss-and-wastage-from-all-stages-of-production-distribution-retail-and-consumption-this-solution-replaces-current-report
  - Building Retrofitting__Project Drawdown defines building retrofitting as the
    renovation of building components (including building envelope, appliances,
    and controls) to include high-efficiency solutions. This replaces the
    conventional practice of retrofitting buildings with conventional solutions.

  - Green & Cool Roofs__Project Drawdown defines cool roofs as building roofs
    that use light reflecting materials or paints. We also define green roofs as
    building roofs with natural vegetation. This replaces the conventional
    practice of building traditional, dark-colored roofs not covered with
    vegetation.____2021-11-24-map-name-green-cool-roofs-description-project-drawdown-defines-cool-roofs-as-building-roofs-that-use-light-reflecting-materials-or-paints-we-also-define-green-roofs-as-building-roofs-with-natural-vegetation-this-replaces-the-conventional-p
  - Refrigerant Management__Project Drawdown defines refrigerant management as
    controlling leakages of refrigerants from existing appliances through better
    management practices and recovery, recycling, and destruction of
    refrigerants at the end of life. This solution replaces conventional
    refrigerant management
