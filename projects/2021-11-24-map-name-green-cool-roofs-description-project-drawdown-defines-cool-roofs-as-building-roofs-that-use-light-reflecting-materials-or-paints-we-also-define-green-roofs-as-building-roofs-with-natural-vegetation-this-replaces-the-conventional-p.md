name: Green & Cool Roofs
description: Project Drawdown defines cool roofs as building roofs that use
  light reflecting materials or paints. We also define green roofs as building
  roofs with natural vegetation. This replaces the conventional practice of
  building traditional, dark-colored roofs not covered with vegetation.
